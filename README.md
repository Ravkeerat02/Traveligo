#### Language Used
- **Tailwind**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling and design.
- **Typescript**: TypeScript is used for adding static types to JavaScript, ensuring type safety during development.
- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications.
- **React**: React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Note
**This documentation focuses on the UI implementation using Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Next.js, and React. Logic can be implemented as needed in the future.**

#### How to Run the Project Locally
   Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ravkeerat02/Traveligo
   cd singlepageapp
```

Install dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
```
Run the development server.
   ```
   npm run dev
```

The project will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a typical Next.js folder structure:

- **`/pages`**: Next.js pages are stored here. Each `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file inside this directory automatically becomes a route in the application.
- **`/styles`**: Contains stylesheets. Tailwind CSS classes can be found here.
- **`/components`**: Reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **`/public`**: Static assets such as images, fonts, and other files are stored here.

## UI Implementation Details

The UI of the application is implemented using **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework. **Tailwind classes are applied directly to the HTML elements**, providing a consistent and responsive design.
